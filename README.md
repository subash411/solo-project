If you are in some kind of mood today and want to share with others how you are feeling or you want to laugh and make others laugh or all you want to do is sit back and watch some random youtube video or upload some video on your own than look no further, here's the spot and place for you and this spot is called Fun Saga.

# Feature

# Description
Fun Saga uses React, Redux, and Saga. It uses Axios to communicate from client side to server and PG for server side to database. I used CSS for all of the styling.
